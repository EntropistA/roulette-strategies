# Roulette Strategies

In this project I used numpy and matplotlib to create representation
of performing simulations of casino roulette games.

## Strategies description

## Conclusion

Although a growing balance is shown even with a win chance below 50%,
there is a big risk on balance.

Because of big number of games a chance of getting many looses on a row arises.
This could lead to loosing all amount, therefore not being able to recover from the next bet.

pros:
- with unlimited money the amount grows on a long run

cons:
- low income on small, most common bets
- big earnings will need many games therefore, a hazard of losing the whole stake arises

## Further research

Add a max bet cap to lower the risk.
